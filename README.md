## Problem Title

SIH 22015: AI-Driven Smart Irrigation & Water Conservation System for Small-Scale Farmers

## Problem Description
Background

Water scarcity is one of the most critical challenges faced by Indian agriculture, especially by small-scale farmers who rely heavily on irregular rainfall and inefficient irrigation methods. Traditional irrigation practices often lead to water wastage, poor crop yield, and improper soil moisture maintenance.

With increasing climate variability, farmers need intelligent and automated tools to optimize water usage, monitor soil health, and make data-driven decisions in real time. However, most existing solutions are either expensive, complex, or not accessible to marginal farmers.

## Problem Description

There is a need for an AI-powered, low-cost, smart irrigation management system that uses real-time environmental data to automate and optimize water usage.

The system should integrate:

• Soil moisture and nutrient monitoring using affordable IoT sensors
• Weather forecast–based irrigation scheduling
• AI-driven crop water requirement predictions
• Automated on-field irrigation control (drip/sprinkler)
• Mobile-first dashboard for farmers in multiple languages
• Data storage for long-term crop analysis and decision making

This solution should help farmers save water, improve crop productivity, reduce manual labor, and enhance climate resilience.

## Expected Outcomes

• Significant reduction in water consumption
• Precise irrigation based on soil, crop, and weather data
• Increased crop yield and improved plant health
• Lower operational labor and irrigation costs
• Better resilience to drought and climate variations
• Easy-to-use digital tools for rural and marginal farmers
• Data insights to support agricultural planning and policymaking
• Contribution toward sustainable agriculture and water conservation at scale

## Proposed Solution

Our proposed solution is an AI-based Smart Irrigation and Water Conservation System that integrates IoT sensors, machine learning, and automated irrigation controllers into one unified platform.

The system continuously monitors soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and nutrient conditions using low-cost sensors. Machine learning models analyze this data along with real-time weather forecasts to determine the optimal irrigation schedule for each crop type.

A mobile app provides farmers with real-time alerts, irrigation recommendations, and sensor insights in their preferred local language. Automated valves and pumps adjust the water flow based on AI decisions, ensuring efficient water distribution.

This solution is unique because it is affordable, offline-capable, and designed specifically for small farms.

## Technical Approach

Key Components

• IoT Sensors – soil moisture, humidity, temperature
• Microcontroller – ESP32 / NodeMCU
• AI/ML Models – crop-water prediction
• Mobile App – farmer interface
• Cloud Database – real-time data storage
• Actuators – automated pump & valve control

## Workflow

Sensors collect soil and climate data

Microcontroller transmits data to the cloud

AI model predicts crop water requirement

System triggers irrigation automatically

Farmer monitors everything via mobile app

## Feasibility and Viability


This solution is highly feasible because it uses low-cost hardware, open-source software, and scalable cloud infrastructure. Environmental data is easy to collect, and the AI models can be trained on regional crop datasets.

Low risks:
• Sensor calibration issues
• Network connectivity challenges
• Weather unpredictability

Mitigation strategies:
• Offline data caching
• SMS-based fallback alerts
• Redundant sensor fusion

## Impact and Benefits

• 40–60% water savings
• Higher agricultural productivity
• Increased income for small farmers
• Reduced dependency on manual irrigation
• Sustainable farming practices
• Support for government water conservation missions
